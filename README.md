# Typing Text Animation
This project creates a smooth typing animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The phrase **“I'm a”** remains static, while the word next to it changes dynamically in a loop. Each word appears with a typing effect and a blinking cursor, simulating real-time input.

## 🔧 Features

- Static text: `"I'm a"`
- Dynamic word rotation: `developer`, `coder`, `learner`, `student`
- Typing animation with blinking cursor
- Responsive and lightweight design
- Easy to customize word list and timing
